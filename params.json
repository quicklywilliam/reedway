  "body": "# 18th Ave Gravel to Trail Project\r\nNeighbors are working together to improve the accessibility and safety for people walking and biking on 18th Ave between Reedway and Ellis.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nA humble block-long stretch of gravel road, 18th Ave between Reedway and Ellis nonetheless sees a lot of use. There's no sidewalk, but many still walk down it. The surface is squirrelly under tire, but many bike down it. \r\n\r\nPerhaps it is simply the most direct route for many trips. 18th Ave connects several important places between the north part of Westmoreland and the town center, including the Holgate Orange Line stop, Llewellyn School, the Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge, and two churches. It is also the most direct continuation from the 19th ave Greenway which dead-ends at Reedway (officially it continues on 20th but many choose not to go that way).\r\n\r\nOr perhaps people are drawn to 18th ave because it's low vehicle traffic volume and gravel surface seem safer and more inviting to those traveling on foot and by bike. People stop to talk at the intersections, and young families let their children run and scoot down the middle of the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, 18th ave also has problems. When vehicles do travel on 18th, it is sometimes unsafe. Visibility at the south end is hampered by a grade and alignment change, stopping distance is decreased by the surface, and the lack of either sidewalks or bikelanes makes road user conflict more likely. In the past, reckless, inattentive, or impaired drivers have skidded out of control through fences and into neighboring houses. More recently several close calls have been reported, including drivers nearly turning into young children.\r\n\r\n18th ave's gravel surface also presents challenges for users with vision or mobility challenges. Neighbors have reported slips and falls, especially at night. As an unimproved road, adjacent neighbors are responsible for maintaining 18th Ave, but the city limits the options for what can be done. The right of way cannot be narrowed or enlarged, the surface must remain the same (gravel on dirt), and no major reconfigurations of the road are allowed. \r\n\r\nThe city has no plans to improve the road. It would allow adjacent neighors to pay to improve it, but the required improvements would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and are thus unlikely to ever occur. Hence, 18th ave has stagnated and problems have gone unaddressed.\r\n\r\n### Community-Initiated Trails Process\r\nHowever, the city recently introduced a new tool for neighbors to improve unimproved rights-of-way. Begining this year, the city began accepting application for 'Community Initiated Trails'. The goal of the program is to improve connectivity by allowing neighbors to improve a ROW to trail standards â€“ rather than road standards, an option is far less expensive and was not formerly available. To read more about the program, see [here](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/66082).\r\n\r\nWe believe 18th Ave between Reedway and Ellis is a great candidate for this program, and have been working with neighbors to gather input and prepare a plan.\r\n\r\nWe have identitied three design Requirements\r\n- Maximize accessibility and safety for cyclist and pedestrians\r\n- Preserve driveway access for adjacent property\r\n- Preserve utility and emergency truck access\r\n\r\nPossible Design Elements:\r\n- Discourage or prevent through-traffic through bollards or diverters at south end\r\n- Preserve driveway, utility and emergency access at north end\r\n- Replace dirt on gravel surface with other pervious trail surface that improves accessibility and safety\r\n- Activate public space through plantings and other streetscape improvements",
